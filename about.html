                        <BR> North Bengal can be broadly divided in three sections. They can be classified as the hills including Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kurseong and Mirik, the plains of Cooch Behar and Malda and the last section is the Terai region consisting
                        of Dooars which is the stretch from of the foothills of Himalaya. We are based in Siliguri in the district of Darjeeling. Siliguri is the gateway to the whole of northeast India and includes seven state four neighboring countries.
